# 🛍️ Market Basket Analysis Using the Apriori Algorithm

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on uncovering shopping patterns from simulated transactional data using the Apriori algorithm. It follows a structured approach to identify frequent itemsets and generate association rules that help reveal relationships between items.

### ✅ Key Highlights:
- Simulates realistic shopping transactions using a pool of common grocery items.
- Converts the transactions into a one-hot encoded format suitable for analysis.
- Applies the Apriori algorithm to identify frequent item combinations based on support.
- Generates association rules using confidence as the evaluation metric.
- Interprets the rules to provide real-world retail insights.

## 🎯 Objectives

- To understand and demonstrate how the Apriori algorithm works in market basket analysis.
- To simulate and preprocess transactional data in a format suitable for association rule mining.
- To identify frequent itemsets that appear together in at least 30% of transactions.
- To generate and interpret association rules with high confidence (≥ 70%) that can influence retail decisions.
